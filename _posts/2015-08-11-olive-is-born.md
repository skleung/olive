At Olive, our goal is to fundamentally change the way we think about healthcare. 

Before anything else, our quality of life depends on our well-being. So to us, it's disappointing that healthcare has been one of the slowest moving sectors of our time. We have built massive data centers, designed cutting-edge algorithms, and put a mobile computer in the hands of nearly every single person on this planet to export thought-bites of 140 characters. But when it comes to our health, we are still dealing with tools that look like and work like they were borrowed from the 80's. That sucks.

Olive isn't about incremental change. We believe in quantum leaps. We are here because 50% of people shouldn't have a life expectancy of 5 years after being diagnosed with heart failure. We are here because there shouldn't be a person dying from diabetes every 7 seconds. We are here because your odds against cancer shouldn't be a coin flip.

Olive is our vehicle to challenge the absurdities of the status quo and build a better system. We're excited to help everyone regain control of their health and defeat human disease.
